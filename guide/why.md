# Why Slidev

## The Problems

There are a lot of feature-rich, general-purpose, WYSIWYG slides makers like [Microsoft PowerPoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/powerpoint) and [Apple Keynote](https://www.apple.com/keynote/). They work pretty well on making nice slides with animations, charts, and many other things, while being very intuitive and easy to learn. So why bother making Slidev?

Slidev is trying to provide the flexibility and interactivity for developers to make their presentation even more interesting, expressive, and attractive by using the tools and technologies they are already familiar with. Slidev separates the content and visual to make you focus on one thing at a time, while being able to share and use the themes with the community.

While Slidev will never tend to replace those slides apps and being beginner friendly, here is a few notions and highlights of Slidev: 

## Slidev

### Text-based

Slidev uses an extended Markdown format to store and organize your slides in a single plain text file. This lets you focus on making the content. And since the content and styles are separated, this also made it possible to switch between different themes effortlessly.

### Themable

Themes for Slidev can be shared and installed using npm packages. And apply them with only one line of config. Check out the [theme gallery](/guide/theme-gallery) or [how to write a theme](/guide/write-a-theme).

### Developer Friendly

Slidev provides the first class support for code highlighting for developers. With Monaco editor built-in, it also empowers you to do live coding / demostraction in your presentation with autocompletion, type hovering and even TypeScript type check support.

### Interactive & Expressive

You can write custom components and use them directly inside your markdown file. And interact with them in the presentation to express your idea in the way that more interserting and intuitive.

### Recording Support

Slidev provides built-in recording and camera view. You can share your presentation with your camera view inside, or record and save seperately for your screen and camera. All with one go, no addition tools needed.

### Portable

Export your slides into PDF, PNGs, or even a hostable Single-page Application (SPA) with a single command, and share them anywhere.

### Hackable

Since Slidev is powered by web technologies, anything that can be done with web apps are also possible with Slidev. For example, WebGL, API requesting, Iframes or even live sharing, it's up to your imaginations!
