# Animations

## Object Animations

To apply "click animations" for elements, you can use the `v-click` directive or `<v-click>` components

```md
# Hello

<!-- this will be invisible until you press next -->
<v-click>

Hello World

</v-click>

<!-- this will be invisible until you press next the second time -->
<v-click>

Hey!

</v-click>
```
