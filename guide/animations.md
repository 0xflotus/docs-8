# Animations

## Click Animations

To apply "click animations" for elements, you can use the `v-click` directive or `<v-click>` components

```md
# Hello

<!-- Component usage: this will be invisible until you press "next" -->
<v-click>

Hello World

</v-click>

<!-- Directive usage: this will be invisible until you press "next" the second time -->
<div v-click class="p-2 text-xl">

Hey!

</div>
```
