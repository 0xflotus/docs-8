# Recording

Slidev has recording and camera view built-in. You can use them to record your presentation easily within one place.

## Camera View

Click the <carbon-user-avatar class="inline-icon-button"/> button in the navigation panel to show your camera view in the presentation. You can drag to move it, and use the handler on the right bottom corner to resize it. The size and position will be presisted in the `localStorage` and it will be consistant across multiple refreshes, so no worries on that.
