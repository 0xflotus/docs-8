# Windi CSS

Since Markdown naturally supports embedded HTML markups. You can actually style your contents the way you want. To provide some convenience, we have [Windi CSS](https://github.com/windicss/windicss) built-in, where you can style directly with class utilities, for example

```html
<div class="grid grids-cols-[100px,1fr] gap-4 pt-4">

### Name

- Item 1
- Item 2

</div>
```
